This folder contains the following files:

1. README.MD
2. AirlineReservations.java - this application assigns seats on a 10 seat airplane (seats 1-5: first class, seats 6-10: economy). If a section is full, the user will be asked if they would like to placed in the other section.
3. DiceRoll.java - this application simulates the rolling of two dice. The dice are rolled 36,000,000 times and a one dimensional array displays the number of times each possible sum appears.
4. DuplicateElimination.java - this application inputs five numbers and displays each number, as long as it is not a duplicate of a number previously entered.
5. SalesCommission.java - this application determines how many salespersons earned salaries in a set of ranges.
6. TurtleGraphics.java - this application creates a computerized sketchpad using a turtle that moves around a 20-by-20 array. This version receives all of the user commands at once (stored in an array) and then process the entire array at one time.
7. TurtleGraphics2.java - this application is the same as TurtleGraphics.java, except the user commands are received and processed one at a time. This application was created to isolate and work through some of the issues encountered when writing TurtleGraphics.
8. VariableLengthList.java - this application calculates the product of a series of integers that are passed to the method product() using a variable length list.
